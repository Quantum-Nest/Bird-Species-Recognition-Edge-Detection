IDEA DESCRIPTION
<br>

Often times when we think about wildlife we tend to forget about our marvellous and exotic flying species. Our algorithm helps identify them for tourists and enthusiastic bird watchers. Conditions of birds are also an excellent indicator of thriving wildlife of a place. Now that climate change has affected us all, these marvellous aves have been migrating from their original habitat into cities, trying to interact with the rest of us. Quantum Bird Species Detector will give a sense of identity to random birds often people witness and would feel less likely to harm them, knowing their heritage and origin.
